notes: |
  Successfully validated the MCP Central Time Server package using proofscan.
  
  The server initialized correctly and exposed 6 time-related tools through
  the MCP protocol. All protocol interactions completed successfully:
  - Connection established via stdio transport
  - Initialize handshake completed (5.6s latency)
  - Tools list retrieved (9ms latency)
  - Clean disconnection
  
  This validation demonstrates a working MCP server implementation that
  provides time and timezone utilities. The server correctly implements
  the 2024-11-05 protocol version and supports tool capability notifications.
  
  Key observations:
  - Package is available on npm as @mcpcentral/mcp-time v0.0.3
  - Server responds with proper JSON-RPC 2.0 messages
  - All 6 tools have well-defined input schemas
  - Server includes helpful stderr message: "MCP Time Server running on stdio"
