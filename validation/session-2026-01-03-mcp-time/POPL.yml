notes: |
  Attempted to validate the MCP time server package using proofscan.
  The package reference '@modelcontextprotocol/server-time' appears in various
  documentation and examples but is not actually published to npm.
  
  This validation session captures the failure mode when attempting to connect
  to a non-existent MCP server package, demonstrating the importance of
  verifying package availability before deployment.
  
  The events log contains 9 protocol events including:
  - Connection attempt with npx command
  - Transport connection established
  - Initialize request sent
  - npm 404 error responses
  - Process exit with error code 1
